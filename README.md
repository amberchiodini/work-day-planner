## Description 
I created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for a typical 9-5 workday.  

## First Look

## Technologies Used 
* HTML/CSS 
* JQuery 

## Installation 
I used [Moment JS](https://momentjs.com/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) to assist with the layout of the application and to create a JavaScript date object.
